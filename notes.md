It might be a bit frustrating especially when you believe you know something but a very small part/feature becomes too hectic to even finish/complete.

My steps:

1. Design the top navigation menu first. 
2. Design the hero section of the main page.
3. design the footer of the page. 


## The header and nav

Three grids

Logo, Main links, CTA sections

I can either use grid or flexbox. 

<!-- the nav only works on desktop -->

I can use sass to make my life easier with buttons links, colors.





# My mobile workflow

In mobile:

Navbar 

image

section

footer.


In desktop

navbar

main with:

section on left and image on right

footer.

If we are using flexbox in the main :

desktop - flex direction row.

mobile and tablet - flex direction column

-- column reverse 
-- column gap increase in mobile. 


## Layering images on top of each other with tilt in angle.
